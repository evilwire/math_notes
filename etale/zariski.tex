We cover a few key results necessary for the development of 
\'etale theory. The flow of ideas will be very close to that of 
Milne, but we fill in the necessary details in case the reader 
doesn't wish to look elsewhere for the reference in question. 
However, we will assume a passing familiarity with Chapter II of 
\cite{Hart}, Chapters II of \cite{Liu}, or Chapter II of 
\cite{Mum}; the content therein will be too much to cover in one 
text without cluttering the motif of the text. For a general 
discussion about schemes, we recommend \cite{Hart} Chapter II
and its exercises.

We make no assumption about schemes (integrality, separatedness, 
projective, etc) unless explicitly stated. 

\section{Finite morphisms}

For the following definitions, let $\phi: X \to Y$ be a morphism of 
schemes.

\begin{defn}
We say that $\phi$ is \DEF{quasi-compact morphism}{quasi-compact}
if the inverse image of any affine open subset $V$ of $Y$ is
quasi-compact. 

If in addition, for any open subset $U$ of $\phi^{-1}(V)$, the 
canonical homomorphism $\O_Y(V) \to \O_X(U)$ makes $\O_X(U)$ into 
a finitely generated $\O_Y(V)$-algebra, then we say that $\phi$ is 
\DEF{finite-type morphism}{finite-type}.
\end{defn}

The reader may be careful to note that the above definition
deviates from the one given in \cite{Hart} II.3, say. In fact,
the two definitions are the same.

\begin{prop}
Let $\phi: X \to Y$ be a morphism of schemes. Then $\phi$ is a 
finite-type scheme morphism if and only if there exists an open 
cover $\{V_i : V_i = \Spec B_i \}$ of $Y$ such that for each $i$, 
$\phi^{-1}(V_i)$ emits a finite cover $\{U_{ij} : U_{ij} = \Spec 
A_{ij}\}$ by affine schemes such that $A_{ij}$ is a finitely 
generated $B_i$-algebra.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\pfitem{$\Rightarrow$}: Fix any covering of $\{V_i : V_i = \Spec 
B_i\}$, and note that $\phi^{-1}(B_i)$ emits a covering by affine
subschemes. Since $\phi^{-1}(B_i)$ is quasi-compact, it follows that
such a covering has a finite subcover. Let $\{U_{ij} : U_{ij} = 
\Spec A_{ij}\}$ be such a finite subcover. Note that $\O_X(U_{ij}) 
= A_{ij}$ is a finitely generated algebra over $\O_Y(V_i) = B_i$.
The ``only if'' direction is established.

\pfitem{$\Leftarrow$} (\cite{Liu} 3.2.2): assume that $\{V_i :
V_i = \Spec B_i\}$ is a cover of $Y$ satisfying the hypothesis
of the proposition.

To see that $\phi$ is quasi-compact, let $V$ be any affine open 
subscheme of $Y$. Then $V \cap V_i$ is open in $V_i$ and has a
covering by principle open subset.\footnote{\DEF{principle open 
subset}{Principle open subsets} of an affine scheme $\Spec B$ are 
subset of the form $V = \Spec B_f$ for some $f \in B$} Since 
affine schemes are quasi-compact, it follows that the collection 
$\{V_{ij}\}$ is finite.

Furthermore, if we let $\{U_{ik}\}$ be the finite affine cover of 
$\phi^{-1}(V_i)$, since $V_{ij}$ is a principle open subset of 
$V_i$, we see that $\phi^{-1}(V_{ij}) \cap U_{ik}$ is a subscheme 
of $U_{ik}$ which is also principle open, and in particular, 
affine.  It follows that $\phi^{-1}(V)$ can also be covered by 
finitely many affine open subschemes. To conclude that 
$\phi^{-1}(V)$ is quasi-compact, we note that finite union of 
quasi-compact subset is quasi-compact.\footnote{The argument here 
is entirely topological. Let $\DSt W = \cup_1^n W_i$, with $W_i$ 
quasi-compact. Indeed, fix any (potentially infinite) cover 
$\{W'_i\}$ of $W$. By intersecting elements of the cover with each 
$W_i$, we have a refinement of the cover where only finitely many 
elements in the cover intersect each quasi-compact piece.}

Let $U \in f^{-1}(V_i)$ be an affine scheme. We want to show that
$\O_X(U)$ is a finitely generated $\O_Y(V_i)$ algebra. Let 
$\{U_{ij} : U_{ij} = \Spec A_{ij}\}$ be the finite affine cover of 
$\phi^{-1}(V_i)$. Notice (1) that $U \cap U_{ij}$ can be covered by
finitely many principle open sets 
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
We say that $\phi$ is \DEF{affine morphism}{affine} if for every 
affine open subset $U$, $\phi^{-1}(U)$ is also affine. 
\end{defn}
