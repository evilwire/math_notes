\chapter{Algebraic Geometry Front Matter and Zariski's Main 
Theorem}
\label{sect_zariski}

We cover a few key results necessary for the development of 
\'etale theory. The flow of ideas will be very close to that of 
Milne, but we fill in the necessary details in case the reader 
doesn't wish to look elsewhere for the reference in question. 
However, we will assume a passing familiarity with Chapter II of 
\cite{Hart}, Chapters II of \cite{Liu}, or Chapter II of \cite{Mum}; the content therein 
will be too much to cover in one text without cluttering the motif 
of the text. For a general discussion about schemes and

We make no assumption about schemes (integrality, separatedness, 
projective, etc) unless explicitly stated.
