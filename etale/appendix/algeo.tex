\Chapter*{Appendix to Chapter I}

There is so much to algebraic geometry. A professor once said that 
it took him two years to scratch the surface of the subject. For 
some others, it may be more. At the risk of writing another book
for algebraic geometry, the author wishes to compile some key 
results, formerly organized as exercises in \cite{Hart}, 
\cite{Liu} or \cite{Mum}, but are crucial for the reader. To go
through these notes, the reader is hoped to have gone through all
chapter and exercises of \cite{AM}
