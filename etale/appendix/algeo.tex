\chapter{Appendix --- Baby AlGeo}

There is so much to algebraic geometry. A professor once said that 
it took him two years to scratch the surface of the subject. For 
some others, it may be more. At the risk of writing another book
for algebraic geometry, the author wishes to compile some key 
results, formerly organized as exercises in \cite{Hart}, 
\cite{Liu} or \cite{Mum}, but are crucial for the reader. The 
purpose of these notes is to make those solutions readily 
available and organized in as useful of a fashion as possible.

Therefore, to make the most out of these notes, a reader should
have done roughly 90\% of all the exercises in Hartshorne at least 
a year ago. The reaction to most of these exercises should be, I
hope, ``ah! I remember now''. It is not encouraged to use these 
notes to get out of doing any form of exercises, as it is often
underhanded to impress other mathematicians with results that one
did not obtain from a book that one did not pay for (or reserved
from the library).

The other requirement (as is understood almost implicitly) is that
the reader is completely familiar with the contents of \cite{AM},
or has a passing familiarity with \cite{MatsCA}.
