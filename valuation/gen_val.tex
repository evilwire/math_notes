These notes cover basic theory of valuation.

\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a multiplicative abelian group. We say that an 
\emph{ordering} is defined in $G$ if we are given a 
multiplicatively closed subset $P$ not including $1$ such that 
$G$ is the disjoint union:
\[
P \dU P^{-1} \dU \{1\}.
\]
In this case, we call $P$ the \emph{positive elements} of $G$.
\end{defn}

For an ordering on $G$, we say that $g < h$ if $hg^{-1} \in P$
